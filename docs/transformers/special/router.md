# Router

The Router transformer allows for routing an artifact to one among the eligible transformers. A sample usecase for this is to choose the server for a war file.

[WarRouter](https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube/tree/main/assets/built-in/transformers/dockerfilegenerator/java/warrouter) and [EarRouter](https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube/tree/main/assets/built-in/transformers/dockerfilegenerator/java/earrouter) are examples of uses of this transformer class.
