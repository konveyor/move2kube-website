# Transform

Now it's time to actually do the transformation according to the plan file we generated in the previous step. The transformation phase runs all of the transformers again, but this time the transformers will use the plan to generate the output files.

During the transformation the transformers might run into situations where it requires some more information to generate the output. In order to get the answer it will ask the user some questions. The questions range from yes/no to multiple choice to string input. Most questions also have a default answer.

Example: Some of the questions Move2Kube will ask is about the type of container registry where you want to push the images to.
It also needs to know the registry namespace, and any authentication necessary for pulling images from that registry.

If you want to skip the QA, you can use the `--qa-skip` flag to accept default answers. However rather than skipping the questions, you can give a config file that contains all of the answers using the `--config` flag.

After the transformation is finished, all the answers are written to a config file called `m2kconfig.yaml`. This can be used for later transformations.

The transformation phase produces all the output files we need including, the Dockerfiles, build scripts for containerizing  various services and Kubernetes Deployment, Service and Ingress YAMLs necessary for deploying our application to a Kubernetes cluster.

In addition Move2Kube also generates the CI/CD pipeline and parameterized versions of all those Kubernetes YAMLs (Helm chart, Kustomize YAMLs, Openshift templates, etc.) for various environments (dev, staging, prod, etc.).

## Prerequisites

1. Finish the previous [Plan](/tutorials/migration-workflow/plan) step before following the steps below.

## Transforming using the CLI

1. Run the transformation in the same directory as the plan file. This will detect the plan file and use it to find the source directory.
    ```
    $ move2kube transform
    ```

    <details markdown="block">
    <summary markdown="block">
        Optional: Provide answers to questions using a config file...
    </summary>
    If you want to avoid the question answers during transformation, you can use this [config file](https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube-demos/blob/main/samples/enterprise-app/config/m2kconfig.yaml)
    ```
    $ move2kube transform --config m2kconfig.yaml
    ```
    </details>

1. Answer all the questions as appropriate. For most questions we can go with the default answers. Some questions to watch out for are:
    - A spurious service called `config-utils` was detected by one of the transformers. We can deselect it when we are asked to select the services we are interested in. We could also do this by editing the plan file.
    - Move2Kube has detected the Maven profiles for each of the Java services. If you are deploying to MiniKube then select the `dev-inmemorydb` profile. Similar questions for the SpringBoot profiles.
    - The container registry and namespace that you want to use. A container registry is where all the images are stored (Example: Quay, Docker Hub, etc.)
    - The ingress hostname and ingress TLS secret. If you are deploying to MiniKube then give `localhost` as the ingress host and leave the TLS secret blank.
    - We will select `:C` for the path to expose the `order` `customers` `inventory` and `gateway` services. We will choose `/` as the path to expose the `frontend` service on. This way only the `frontend` will be exposed outside the cluster through the Ingress.

## Transforming using the UI

1. Continuing from the previous step in the UI. Scrolling down from the plan section we see the `outputs` section. Click the `start transformation` button.

    ![No project inputs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/migration-workflow/15-no-project-outputs.png)

1. This brings up a modal to ask the user some questions to guide the transformation.

    ![QA 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/migration-workflow/16-qa-1.jpeg)

1. Answer all the questions as appropriate. For most questions we can go with the default answers. Some questions to watch out for are:
    - A spurious service called `config-utils` was detected by one of the transformers. We can deselect it when we are asked to select the services we are interested in. Again, we could have done this by editing the plan file.
    - Move2Kube has detected the Maven profiles for each of the Java services. Since we are deploying to a cluster (like MiniKube) we will select the `prod-externaldb` profile. Similar questions for the SpringBoot profiles.
    - The container registry and namespace that you want to use. A container registry is where all the images are stored (Example: Quay, Docker Hub, etc.)
    - The ingress hostname and ingress TLS secret. If you are deploying to MiniKube then give `localhost` as the ingress host and leave the TLS secret blank.

## Using the output generated by Move2Kube transform

For a sample output of what Move2Kube generates for this enterprise app, see [this](https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube-demos/tree/main/samples/enterprise-app/output)

Now that we have generated the output, we can run the scripts inside the `scripts` directory.

1. The `builddockerimages.sh` script will build all the container images for each service using the Dockerfiles that were generated.
    ```
    $ cd myproject/scripts/
    $ ./builddockerimages.sh
    ```
1. The `pushimages.sh` script will push them to the container registry we specified.
    ```
    $ ./pushimages.sh
    ```
1. Since we selected the `prod-externaldb` profile we will deploy the database using the yamls given [here](https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube-demos/tree/main/samples/enterprise-app/database)
    ```
    $ cd ..
    $ curl https://move2kube.konveyor.io/scripts/download.sh | bash -s -- -d samples/enterprise-app/database -r move2kube-demos
    $ minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 2 # do this only if you are deploying to Minikube
    $ kubectl apply -f database/
    ```
1. Finally we can deploy the Kubernetes yamls that Move2Kube generated to our cluster
    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/yamls
    ```
1. Now that our application is running on the cluster, we can get the URL where the app has been deployed to, using `kubectl get ingress myproject -o yaml`  
If you deployed to Minikube, make sure to enable the ingress addon and start `minikube tunnel` so that we can access the ingress on `localhost`.
    ```console
    $ minikube addons enable ingress
    💡  After the addon is enabled, please run "minikube tunnel" and your ingress resources would be available at "127.0.0.1"
        ▪ Using image k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.0.4
        ▪ Using image k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/kube-webhook-certgen:v1.1.1
        ▪ Using image k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/kube-webhook-certgen:v1.1.1
    🔎  Verifying ingress addon...
    🌟  The 'ingress' addon is enabled
    $ minikube addons enable ingress-dns
    💡  After the addon is enabled, please run "minikube tunnel" and your ingress resources would be available at "127.0.0.1"
        ▪ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/minikube-ingress-dns:0.0.2
    🌟  The 'ingress-dns' addon is enabled
    $ minikube tunnel
    ❗  The service/ingress myproject requires privileged ports to be exposed: [80 443]
    🔑  sudo permission will be asked for it.
    🏃  Starting tunnel for service myproject.
    Password:
    ```
    Now the app should be available on [http://localhost](http://localhost)

## Next steps

> Optionally, As part of the above transformation if runtime information of the cloud foundry app is required, you can use the collect output in planning and transformation : [Collect information from running apps](/tutorials/migration-workflow/collect)

### Customizing the output

After inspecting the output that Move2Kube produced we might see some things we want to change. For example, we might want to change the base image used in the Dockerfiles, add some annotations to the Ingress YAML, maybe change the output directory structure, change which values are parameterized in the Helm chart, generate some new files, etc. For all these user specific requirements and more, we can use customizations.

Next step [Customizing the output](/tutorials/customizing-the-output)
