## move2kube

Move2Kube creates all the resources required for deploying your application into kubernetes, including containerisation and kubernetes resources.

### Synopsis

Move2Kube creates all resources required for deploying your application into kubernetes, including containerisation and kubernetes resources.
	It supports translating from docker swarm/docker-compose, cloud foundry apps and even other non-containerized applications.
	Even if the app does not use any of the above, or even if it is not containerized it can still be transformed.
